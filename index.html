        const text = `Once upon a time in the quaint town of Serenity Falls, there lived a young woman named Lily. She had a heart as pure as the crystal-clear stream that ran through the meadows, and her laughter echoed like the sweet melody of a songbird. Lily's days were filled with the simple joys of life—tending to her garden, exchanging pleasantries with the townsfolk, and basking in the warmth of the sun that painted the sky in hues of orange and pink each evening.

In the same town, there lived a young man named Oliver. He was known for his kind soul and his skillful hands that crafted beautiful wooden sculptures. Oliver's workshop, nestled at the edge of the woods, was a haven of creativity and tranquility. His carvings told stories of love and joy, capturing the essence of the emotions that danced within his heart.

One day, as fate would have it, Lily happened upon Oliver's workshop during a stroll through the woods. The sound of his chisel striking wood filled the air, and Lily was drawn to the enchanting melodies of creation. Oliver looked up from his work, and their eyes met in a moment that seemed to suspend time.

From that day forward, Lily and Oliver found themselves intertwined in a dance of friendship and shared passions. They would spend hours in the workshop, Lily marveling at the magic Oliver sculpted from blocks of wood. As the seasons changed, so did the nature of their bond. The warmth of their friendship blossomed into a love as deep and enduring as the roots of the ancient trees that stood witness to their story.

One summer evening, under the canvas of a starlit sky, Oliver gathered his courage and confessed his feelings to Lily. He spoke of the way her laughter lit up his darkest days and how her presence was like a gentle breeze, comforting and invigorating all at once. Lily, touched by his sincerity, found her heart echoing the same sentiments.

Their love story unfolded like a delicate tapestry, woven with moments of shared dreams, whispered promises, and stolen glances. As the years passed, Lily and Oliver faced the ebb and flow of life's challenges hand in hand, their love growing stronger with each passing season.

In Serenity Falls, their love became a legend—a testament to the enduring power of connection and the magic that happens when two hearts beat as one. And so, in the heart of the quaint town, Lily and Oliver's workshop stood as a symbol of a love that, like the finest sculpture, was crafted with care, patience, and an unwavering belief in the beauty of shared dreams.`;
